1.Tiny and wonderful creatures
Have you ever seen tiny creatures marching in your kitchen? Have they ever messed up your picnic or crawled on you?
Have you ever wondered about where they come from and where they go to? Can you guess who they are? Yes! They are ants.
Ants are part of the insect kingdom. They are more ecologically important than you think.
Some ants live on other animals and protect them from parasites. .Some ants herd other insectsthat provide food for the ants.
Some ants harvest seeds.Some ants grow fungus to feed the colony. Good farmers. Aren't they?

2.Social Ants
Do you kow ants live in colonies? ....social ...... There are three castes of ants and they perform different roles.
Queens are females who were fed more when they were larvae, so they’re bigger than the workers. 
The queens lay all the eggs in the colony (amounting to millions in some species). 
They have wings and fly to find a mate. They tear their wings off before forming a new colony. 
After mating, the queen starts a new nest (colony) and raises her first worker offspring. 
This is the only time in her life that the queen does any work other than laying eggs.
Workers are females who were fed less when they were larvae. Workers are wingless and don’t reproduce. 
They do all the other jobs in the colony, including gathering food, building the nest and taking care of the young.  
Males have wings and fly to mate with queens. The males don’t do any chores in the colony. Their only job is to mate with the queens. 
They die shortly after mating, so the only time you’ll see them is during this act.
Communication:
As we all read in the “Ant and Grosshopper” story, Ants are hard working. 
But do you know how ants communicate with their nestmates to find food? They use special chemical scent called pheromones.
Pheromones help the ants to trace back their nests after food hunt. they also leave Pheromones when they go back home after food hunt. 
So the shortest trail has the strongest scent. This will be the preferred trail. Now you can imagine how they are marching in a straight 
line onto your dining table.
